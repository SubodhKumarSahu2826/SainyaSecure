# Military Comms System

A next-generation battlefield communication simulator for defense and tactical scenarios. It demonstrates peer-to-peer (P2P) communications, secure encryption, distributed event ordering with vector clocks, tamper-proof blockchain logging, and robust offline-first resilience—protecting mission-critical information against jamming, failure, or cyber attacks.

## 🚀 Features

- **P2P Network Simulation** - Field, command, and relay nodes with real-time status & partition handling  
- **End-to-End Encryption** - Simulated RSA/AES with message signing & verification  
- **Message Ordering** - Vector clock-based distributed event integrity  
- **Blockchain Ledger** - Immutable, auditable, in-memory blockchain for every message  
- **Offline-first & Partition Tolerance** - Reliable delivery/order even during network drops  
- **Message Priority & Status** - Label messages (critical, high, medium, low) with delivery states  
- **Modern UI** - Tactical messages, network topology, blockchain & system status dashboards

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React / Next.js
- **Simulation/Logic:** TypeScript (custom modules for P2P, blockchain, clocks)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
- **Encryption:** Simulated RSA, AES, and signature utilities
- **Offline Buffering:** Future-ready with IndexedDB / Service Workers
- **Visualization:** Custom dashboard UI components

## 📄 Getting Started

```
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser
```

## 🏆 Why This Project?

- **Simulates real defense communication vulnerabilities** (jamming, data leaks, spoofing)
- **Blockchain-backed audit trail** for after-action reviews & trust
- **Educational, extensible, and ready for hackathons, research, or demonstration**
